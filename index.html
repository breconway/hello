    <h1>Breana</h1>
    <p>I have taken art and photography classes every year that I have been in school (if the elementary and middle school's mandatory classes count). I love drawing and photography the most.  This is my third semester as an Advertising Design major. This is my first webpage design class, though!</p>
    <p>In my time here at JCTC I expect to further my knowledge of design and grow a portfolio that I can use to show potential future employers!</p>
